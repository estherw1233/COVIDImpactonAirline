# COVIDImpactonAirline

In this project, we are looking at the impact of Covid-19 on job counts in the airline industry, specifically in Northern America, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America.

We analyzed job inflow and outflow and counts from 2018-2020 in order to see whether there was a descent in employment.

In order to get a better understanding of the forces driving any changes in employment, we looked at the data at the company, job category, and gender level.
